3D-Game
========

Made in the context of my computer graphics class.

3D game coded in C++ and using OpenGL, GLM and GLFW. Made in the context of my computer graphics class. A codebase was provided.

We had to implement all the graphics and the game logics (including AABB and OBB collision detections).

The codebase was used for setting up GLFW and OpenGL.
